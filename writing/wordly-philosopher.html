My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4839858825">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I'll lead with a quote from Lord Keynes, "The ideas of economists and political philosophers both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back." <br /><br />Given that this book is short, Heilbroner must paint with a broad brush. But what he paints is meaningful, insightful, and a beautiful picture quickly emerges. I feel this book should be a must-read for the high school economics student or the incoming economics university student. The big picture is the most important. It provides the motivation and the reason why a student should care about a subject. It should come before the minutiae of microeconomics and the dry Keynesian equations of macroeconomics. <br /><br />I like Heilbroner's love of economics. He sees economics as the great shaper of thoughts. As the unknown, unassuming, shadow behind revolution, behind political decision-making, behind social organization. When I was in college, I remember questioning why there was a Nobel prize in Economics. I thought how could such a seemingly boring and unimportant social science compete with the likes of Physics or Chemistry. I could have used Heilbroner's view then. To shake me from the tight grip of Keynesian economic theory and to open my eyes to the true power of economic thought. <br /><br />I like Heilbroner's prose. By today's standard, it is a bit posh, but any English prose written in the 1950s would seem posh by today's standards. His grasp of language is such that he slots in unique and not oft-seen vocabulary that fits well in a given situation. He gives zest and verve to a topic that many people only know as dry and boring. <br /><br />I like Heilbroner's choice of Economists. Adam Smith. Parson Malthus. David Ricardo. John Stuart Mill. Karl Marx. Frederich Engels. Thorstein Veblen. John Maynard Keynes. He focused on economists with big, revolutionary ideas that captured imaginations and started movements. He didn't just tell us their ideas but gave us a picture of both the men and the times that he inhabited. With this picture, it was striking to me how each man was a product of their times, a product of the environment in which they lived. Maybe it's a bias of looking back into history, but each worked in the framework of the problems of their times. While it may seem like an obvious statement, even these great men were bound by their environments. The only person I have come across that seems unbound by the constraints of his environment was the extraordinary Leonardo da Vinci.<br /><br />There is still more work to be done. As inequality continues to increase, as technology advances at a rate far beyond what these economists could have imagined, economics as a philosophy is needed once more. As John Stuart Mill pointed out, we get to decide the distribution of wealth in our society. <br />
