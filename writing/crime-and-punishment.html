My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3817363233">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This is a book that made me feel deeply. <br /><br />There are scenes in this book that will be hard to forget. Rodion Raskolnikov's childhood memory when the peasant Mikolka beats his horse to death. Semyon Marmeladov's sober soliloquy on his singular role in his family's terrible poverty and misfortune. Porfiry Petrovich's three questionings of Raskolnikov and his deep understanding of his suspect's mentality. Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigailov's deception and final redemptive act towards Donya before his suicide. Raskolnikov's confession to Sonya. Katerina Ivanovna Marmeladov's funeral dinner fiasco for her husband. <br /><br />Dostoevsky would draw me in. It felt as though the scenes were unfolding faster and faster, the words tumbling over and over, and I was a frantic viewer just trying to keep up. Sometimes the words would flow like thoughts and I was privy to the workings of the character's mind. I would stand there with them and think alongside them. It was a style of writing that consumed me. <br /><br />This book made me think deeply. <br /><br />It made me think about suffering. How logic and emotion often operate in orthogonal planes. The mind can be utterly convinced of an idea or fact, yet the body can still rebel. <br /><br />I think we as humans need the changes, the oscillations to feel anything at all. It is in the change where feeling resides. To be happy, I need to have once been sad. To be angry, I need to have been content. And to suffer, well, one needed to have been free. For an individual, suffering comes from choices he made while free. Choices that confined him. And the only way back to freedom is through suffering. <br /><br />It made me think about irrationality. How humans can view the same situation in completely different lights if some part of the context is changed. That we can so easily identify flaws and contradictions in others, but often cannot see our own. Or if we can see our contradictions, that we choose to ignore them, rather than face them head-on. <br /><br />This book was consuming. I think it will consume you as well.
