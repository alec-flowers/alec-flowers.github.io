My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4791061087">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
The Wright brothers are very inspiring. They were straight-edge teetotalers who never married and who always worked hard. I was impressed that with no college education, and with little outside guidance, they were able to overcome major engineering challenges to become the first people to fly. I think the brotherly bond was an important dynamic as they each had their own strengths, they could really argue out issues to look at it from all sides and find the best solution, and they had absolute trust in one another. <br /><br />The bishop, their father, played a huge part in their being who they were. He always made time for his reading and made sure that everyone in the family read. Even though he was a bishop, he had a book with writings from a famous agnostic and encouraged the family to read these arguments and form their own independent opinions. The family library included Encyclopedias, Darwin, Dickins, Irving, Hawthorne, Twain, Gibbons. I would like to have a library like this one day. He also placed a high emphasis on informal learning outside of school and if the boys missed school for a day or two to pursue something he thought worthwhile, he would let them.<br /><br />At the end there is a discussion on patent issues and it is argued, only once the brothers showed how it could be done, then everyone could fly. While this statement is true, I do think we in western cultures place a lot of emphasis on the individual "great woman/man" or "great inventor" idea. There is an idea of social intelligence, where individual brains are sites of recombination of the collective knowledge and ideas that are prevalent in society. Often discoveries are made simultaneously because at that time a discovery is made humanity has necessarily solved the main building blocks leading up to that discovery. For example, the Wright brothers were not exempt from the collective as their entire knowledge foundation was built upon books they had read, other gliders which they had seen tested out, the development of the engine, data shared from other inventors (while wrong it pushed them to figure the information out for themselves). They were able to succeed where others didn't because they pushed slightly beyond the collective knowledge through their engineering expertise, through discussions and arguments among themselves, and through many small technical inventions. I think with or without the Wright brothers humanity would have figured out how to fly relatively quickly (within a few years). Even before they had done a demonstration in France, to prove they could fly, there were other pilots who were able to stay off the ground for minutes. <br /><br />This book is shorter than David McCulloughs other works and I felt like there must have been less historical material to work with here, in the way of journals, telegrams, new articles etc. I was a bit wanting at times and wished for a bit more focus on the brother's upbringing, and more about the father's upbringing and background.
