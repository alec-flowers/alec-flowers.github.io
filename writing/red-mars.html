My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4733641615">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I am happy I read this book, but there were times it was a bit of a slog to get through. <br /><br />I wasn't in love enough with Mars, the geography, and the technology to really get into some of the descriptions and found myself skimming through these parts. However, I was intrigued by the ideas that KSR scattered through the book. <br /><br />Through this fantastical but not unrealistic idea of establishing a colony on Mars and by blending realism with science fiction, KSR is able to comment on existing society, to point out dichotomies in our current thinking and living that if continued could lead to dystopian events which he describes. <br /><br />There is a constant tension between the technological prowess and abilities of the first 100 and their inability to shed their inherently human social nature. They end up forming factions and cliques, split apart by ideological differences. There are those who want to terraform Mars, full throttle, so it can natively support human life and those who want to leave it untouched. There are those who want the journey to be purely scientific, to view their work as a scientific expedition, and those who see life as inherently political and maneuver to ingratiate themselves with the larger powers (Phyllis) or who want to create a new social order, different from that back on earth (Arkady)<br /><br />In KSR's plot, the realist vision wins out and Mars starts turning into a microcosm of earth and earth's problems, even against the best efforts of many of the first 100. The main problem being Mars becomes a return on investment for transnational corporations who subvert global treaties with ease (like current corporations do with taxes), ignore agreements, and work to extract resources as fast as possible with no regard for over-population, environmental consequences/concerns, long term contingency planning or any other externalities. <br /> <br />The book made me think about the concept of RealPolitik or power politics that Otto Von Bismark the Prussian Statesman who unified Germany espoused. The essence of Realpolitik is not being bound by dogma, ideology, or moral considerations, but by changing diplomatic or political strategy based on current knowledge and circumstances. This was successful for Bismark because other nations were still playing the game of being bound by ideological or moral considerations, however, they eventually transitioned to a Realpolitik strategy. To me, it seems like RealPolitik is a sort of trump move for the short time horizon in a game theory game. If you start playing it, then you will be successful unless your opponents adopt the same strategy, and then we will be back at a balanced game. Think prisoners dilemma where it is always best to act in your self-interest and tattle on the other prisoner. <br /><br />I see this manifest itself often in business, and in this book, the transnationals are motivated by short-term profit and returning value on their investments. They are willing to bend the rules of the game and trample over those who are in their paths. While they seemed to be on their way to high margin profits, their RealPolitik led the opposing forces to adopt the same strategy in return, which manifested itself into open rebellion and destruction of any current infrastructure which supported the transnationals. Otto Von Bismark's RealPolitik ended in WW1, and here it ended in the destruction of a large part of Mars and neither side profiting.<br /><br />The big question is, how do we design a society that puts a priority on the longer term? In the book, they develop an "immortality treatment" and we can already see this altering the thinking of many of the characters. Would it take living forever to get people to wake up and care about climate change? <br /><br />There were phrases, sentences, and paragraphs that caught my attention and really made me think, as they incisively commented on some part of society. <br /><br />I'll end with a few quotes/events that highlight, far better than I can summarize, poignant commentaries of the human condition: <br /><br />"People didn’t understand that true intimacy did not consist of sexual intercourse, which could be done with strangers and in a state of total alienation; intimacy consisted of talking for hours about what was most important in one’s life."<br /><br />"Tatiana Durova had been killed by a crane tipped by a robot, and Nadia was inconsolable. But grief runs off us, Michel thought as he sat with her, like rain off a duck. In time Nadia would be well. Meanwhile there was nothing to be done."<br /><br />The argument between Sax Russell and Ann Clayborne over terraforming.<br /><br />"Power wasn’t a matter of job titles, after all. Power was a matter of vision, persuasiveness, freedom of movement, fame, influence. The figurehead stands at the front, after all, pointing the way."<br /><br />“Anyway that’s a large part of what economics is—people arbitrarily, or as a matter of taste, assigning numerical values to non-numerical things. And then pretending that they haven’t just made the numbers up, which they have. Economics is like astrology in that sense, except that economics serves to justify the current power structure, and so it has a lot of fervent believers among the powerful.”<br /><br />“The King asked his wise men for some single thing that would make him happy when he was sad, but sad when he was happy. They consulted and came back with a ring engraved with the message ‘This Too Will Pass.’"<br /><br />"They are richer than us. And in this system, richer is more powerful.”<br /><br />"...it does not give back but rather enriches a floating international elite while impoverishing everything else, and so of course the so-called rich elite are in actuality poor as well, disengaged from real human work and therefore from real human accomplishment, parasitical in the most precise sense, and yet powerful too as parasites that have taken control can be, sucking the gifts of human work away from their rightful recipients which are the seven generations, and feeding on them while increasing the repressive powers that keep them in place!”<br /><br />"There were people on Mars and there were beggars in the streets of the nation’s capital, and all the lawyers walked by them every day, their freedom-and-justice talk no more than a cover for their greed."<br /><br />"...suddenly he didn’t care about anything and was sick of pretending he did. Sick of all pretense everywhere, the glutinous oil that allowed society to run on in its gnashing horrid way."<br /><br />Frank Chalmers master-slave discussion related to Islam's treatment of women.<br /><br />"It was a mistake to speak one’s mind at any time, unless it perfectly matched your political purpose; and it never did. Best to strip all statements of real content, this was a basic law of diplomacy. Out on the escarpment he had forgotten that."<br /><br />"It made him wonder just how much the memory held, and if its storage might not be immensely more powerful than its retrieval mechanism. Might one be able to remember every second of one’s life, but only in dreams that were always lost on waking? Might this be necessary, somehow? And if so, what would happen if people started living for two or three hundred years?"
