My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5021201576">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I thought I understood Darwin’s theory of evolution and all its implications. And then I read The Selfish Gene. <br /><br />When conversations about old age come up, I can’t help but interject with the gene theory of why we have death in the first place. A quality of a good gene is to postpone the death of the survival machine to after reproduction (we being the survival machine). The theory says old age is a by-product of the accumulation of late-acting lethal and semi-lethal genes whose negative influence is only felt after reproduction and therefore avoid being selected out of the population by natural selection. <br /><br />On phone calls with my mom, I can’t help but explain how I am 1/2 of her genes and therefore among her closest genetic relative in this world, which is why she should care about me. I go on to explain that we can use game theory to build prisoner dilemma-esque games that help us understand how behaviors in groups evolved and stabilized over time. This mathematical formulation simplifies away real-world complexities to focus on the most important dynamics. It allows us to construct a simplified world where we can set a few simple parameters and then simulate how populations will evolve. In doing so we can understand evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) which are strategies that in the long run are stable and the population will converge too. <br /><br />When I meet new strangers, I ask them if they have heard of natural selection, and then explain the mind-blowing fact that it is a general law in itself and acts on in-organic objects. “Darwin's survival of the fittest is a special case of a more general law of ‘survival of the stable’.” In essence, natural selection is also at play among non-organic objects. More stable molecules will tend to last longer than less stable ones and become more numerous. <br /><br />When I am alone I mull over the strategy Tit-for-Tat and think about how forgiving behaviors manifest themselves in our current society. <br /><br />With my friends I have them think about their ancestors, and about the simple fact that every one of their ancestors was a survivor. Every single one of our ancestors survived to child-bearing age and had children. We are survivors. I think of the French Revolution of 1789 where they used the address “Comrade” and imagine Darwinians adopting the title “Survivor”.<br /><br />Over lunch with my co-workers I inquire if they feel immortal. When they look at me with a puzzled expression, I say that the DNA in every single one of our cells is the closest thing to immortal that we know on earth. Dawkins's definition of a gene comes from G.C. Williams and is as follows, “ A gene is defined as a portion of chromosomal material that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection.” By definition our genes are pseudo-immortal. Genes don’t grow senile or old and successful ones will have propagated from generation to generation and are thousands or millions of years old. We as individual survival machines are transient, mere transport vessels, and are cast aside once our purpose of replication has been served. <br /><br />As you can see I’ve been thoroughly enamored by this book. Another favorite book of mine is Sapiens, because of how Yuval Noah Harari frames history and explains his theories for why things developed as they did. The Selfish Gene is a new favorite of mine because I feel like I understand the world a bit better. <br /><br />The most interesting argument came towards the end when Dawkins plants a stake in the ground and says that he believes any life found in the universe will be Darwinian life. What he means by this is that he believes life can only occur through the process of natural selection. For life to exist there must have existed first a replicator. A replicator is a molecule that can make copies of itself. Any replicating process cannot be perfect. So with the copying process, we get random inconsistencies from mistakes made in the copying process. The last item necessary is a constrained environment where resources can become scarce. This exists inherently in the universe as there is a finite amount of matter in any given space. In this way, natural selection begins its slow random march toward the creation of life. <br /><br />I noticed that in this particular branch of science, logic reigns supreme. Often the theories being debated cannot easily be evaluated experimentally or with data, and therefore it is up to logical arguments. The arguments try to fit a certain theory to the existing knowledge about various animal groups, and the success of the theory can come down to how successfully an author can argue his points and counter opposing arguments. A concrete example is when Dawkins describes Wynne Edward’s group theory approach to evolution and contrasts it to the selfish gene theory. The group theory approach says that individual animals will moderate their birth rates for the good of the group as a whole. The selfish gene says that an individual will moderate their birth rate based on maximizing the probability that their child survives into adulthood. Dawkins highlights multiple behaviors observed in the animal kingdom and points out the explanation given by a group theorist and that of a selfish gener, and in the end, it is up to the reader to decide which seems more plausible. <br /><br />I notice parallels between the selfish gene theory and that of Adams Smith’s invisible hand. The invisible hand says that by individuals working for their selfish gain, and only their selfish gain, the system works quite well, and everyone benefits. The selfish gene theory seems to espouse a similar idea, that being selfish as a gene promotes behaviors and outcomes in the replicating machines that make the system work ie a species cooperates to an extent that many of them benefit. <br /><br />An important lesson I took away from the book is that often the most difficult part of answering a question is even realizing (or framing) there is a question in the first place. I think this is an often overlooked part of science, as when looking back on solved problems, the question always seems quite clear. This reminds me of an interview with Marc Andreessen where he talks about the early days of the internet revolution in the 1970s and 80s and how it wasn’t clear at all that there was a future for computers. The inventor of the first arcade machine only made 1 and was surprised to find after 3 days so many quarters had been shoved into the machine that it broke. Of course, looking back it seems obvious that computers would be successful and there would be a huge market for video games. <br /><br />I highly recommend this book and think anyone who reads it will learn many new things and gain a new perspective on our world.
