                Valley Startup</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17575761.John_Carreyrou">John
                Carreyrou</a><br />
            My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4916231344">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
            I listened to this with a group and this book elicited more gasps of shock or disbelief than anything I have
            read previously. It made for an exciting read that kept us thinking, "can it even get worse?"
            <br /><br />The first part of the book read like a set of interviews conducted after the fact. I found it
            difficult to believe that people weren't injecting in their knowledge that Theranos had failed to make
            themselves seem more prescient. The stories seemed a bit disjointed and were combined together in a sloppy
            manner. Carreyrou relied heavily on a few sources and I felt he took their accounts at face value. I would
            have preferred a book that was better researched and that didn't read like a long-form investigative
            journalism cover story. (note I am biased after reading Robert Caro and Ron Chernow) <br /><br />The back
            half of the book that was told from Carreyrou's perspective was the most compelling and interesting part of
            the story. <br /><br />Elizabeth Holmes was a terrible person. She lied to investors, employees, the public,
            patients, and doctors. She created a culture of fear and terror for employees who worked to support her
            dream. She used high-powered lawyers and intimidation as batons to bash opponents into submission even when
            it was clear that she was the liar. She knowingly sent out inaccurate blood results for years that caused
            untold harm to patients. Her actions led to the suicide of an important early employee which she callously
            ignored. <br /><br />Her ability to woo older white men with money was what allowed her to cheat for so
            long. It is reminiscent of Lyndon B. Johnson's ability to cultivate older white men. <br /><br />Influential
            connections -> Money -> Overpromising -> Lies / Cutting Corners -> High Powered lawyers -> Intense Secrecy
            -> Fraud / Medical Malpractice<br /><br />A few takeaways:<br />Connections are incredibly important and can
            lend credibility even when you have none to speak of. <br /><br />Powerful ideas can be alluring and
            intoxicating. <br /><br />Overpromising and underdelivering does not work in the field of medical devices.
            <br /><br />VC and corporate due diligence is laughable at times. When others have piled in they jump in as
            well. <br /><br />FOMO is a powerful motivator. <br /><br />Boards of Directors need to take an active role
            in corporate oversight. <br /><br />It was interesting many fooled board members were very old (90 years
            plus) for example George Schultz and Henry Kissinger and their obsession with supporting Elizabeth.
