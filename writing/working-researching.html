                Writing</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/722.Robert_A_Caro">Robert A.
                Caro</a><br />
            My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4732594964">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
            This small glimpse into how Caro wrote his masterpieces is very inspiring. While some of this was pulled
            from old interviews or articles, most of it was new to me. <br /><br />I realized that Caro is not only a
            great writer, but also master interviewer and researcher. I almost think his research, his compulsion to
            track down anyone involved, to learn every detail, to know the facts, to re-interview over and over again,
            to move for 3 years to a new place for his book, is even more impressive than the writing itself.
            <br /><br />I took away two main points:<br />1) you have to turn every page <br />2) to make the readers
            see, you have to really see
            <br /><br />
