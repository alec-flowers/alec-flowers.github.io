            My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5538157117">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
            If you are Catholic, you have the Bible. A Muslim, the Quran. A Latter Day Saint, the Book of Mormon. As an
            Atheist who believes in the scientific method, I have the history of science and the great man that is
            Thomas S. Kuhn. <br /><br />I was first introduced to the history of science in a course at EPFL titled, the
            Experimental History of Science. Led by Ion Mihailescu and Simon Primbault our first class meeting was at
            the local Cantonal archives where we poured over old naturalist papers and engineering patents from hundreds
            of years ago. That was my first experience outside the realm of ordered lines on textbook pages or of the
            Wikipedia of Leibnitz or Newton. I went on to read the work of Benjamin Franklin, Experiments and
            Observations on Electricity, and to recreate a select few of his experiments with Leyden Jars. This
            experience opened my eyes to the fact that science is not a neat and orderly process, and many times the
            theories and hypothesis that even great men had were fallible. It also opened a window into the thinkings of
            a great man, and showed that his search for the answers was difficult and driven by an incredible curiosity
            and tenacity. <br /><br />Reading Kuhn was a second step in this journey. I felt as though something was
            clicking into place for the first time. He showed me the picture in the inkblot and now I can never go back
            to see it any other way. Kuhn breaks Science into two parts. The first is normal science. This is when a
            paradigm has been agreed too by a scientific community and scientists are puzzlers, trying to put pieces
            together. The second is revolutionary science. This is when the current paradigm is being questioned because
            it just doesn’t fit and the community is casting about trying to find a solution that will resolve the
            problems and open up new questions. Previous to Kuhn science was seen as continual progress, where we were
            always building on top of the shoulders of others. Kuhn showed us that this picture is not quite right. The
            illusion of a clean history of progress learned through textbooks clouds the truth. Scientists are fooled by
            their inability to know what it was like before the existing paradigm. The language that they currently use
            no longer has the same meaning as it did in the previous paradigm. The questions that they look into are
            different to the ones available before. It is not a perfect analogy, but I am reminded of the theory of
            evolution and why it took so long to formulate the idea. It was because evolution acted so slowly that
            people couldn’t see the changes over the generations. Each farmer lived in their own “paradigm” where the
            cattle were only so aggressive and so large and looked a certain way. When that farmer died and the son took
            over, the knowledge of the previous paradigm was lost. <br /><br />It is interesting to think that the
            process of science continues today. We currently hold beliefs that while useful, don’t actually fit all the
            data and are therefore not correct. They don’t yet describe the truth about the universe. This begs the
            question, Is there an absolute truth? I like Kuhns answer to this question. That each new paradigm is
            progress away from the previous which once worked well, but wasn’t adequate in some way. This is nice as it
            avoids the question by turning around the idea of us progressing towards absolute truth. In some sense does
            it really matter what is absolutely true? Even in axiomatic frameworks such as in mathematics, through the
            work of Kurt Gödel we know that there are limits to what can be true. Kuhn argues that what matters is not
            truth, but operating in productive paradigms that give us new problems to solve and allow us to continue to
            make progress. <br /><br />Our modern world is shaped in every way due to scientific progress. It has
            allowed us to fight devastating wars. To grow our population to staggering levels. To eradicate diseases and
            cure debilitating illness. To move quickly across our planet and communicate even faster. To travel into
            outer space. This book peels back the process of science itself, demystifying how science evolves. I think
            it is a must read for any aspiring Scientist.
