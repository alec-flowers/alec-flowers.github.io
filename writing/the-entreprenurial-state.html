My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4921582250">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This was a tour de force by Mazzucato. The Entrepreneurial State has completely changed my perception of government and the innovation ecosystem. Being born and raised in Silicon Valley I was a disciple of the zeitgeist that saw venture capital and private enterprise as the sole originators of innovation and worshipped the tech visionaries such as Jobs, Musk, Gates, Dorsey, and Hoffman who “singlehandedly” brought innovative products to the world. I feel as though a veil has been lifted and I am re-evaluating ideas of free-market capitalism, income inequality, climate change, and short-term thinking. <br /><br />The main idea that runs through Mazzucato’s book is that the state is the true origin of innovation. People think the state is slow, bureaucratic, and the antithesis of innovation. People think the state often “picks losers”, a moniker for funding firms that fail, and should leave innovative activities to private business and venture capital, whose returns prove that they know all about successful innovation. <br /><br />Mazzucato busts this myth over and over to highlight the essential role in innovation the state plays, especially in the riskiest and earliest phases where private enterprise won’t go. It is the state that takes the biggest risks by investing in basic science, research, and early ventures that are too risky for VC’s. She shows that the state not only invests in innovation, but chooses the next innovation direction through a concerted effort in aligning its funding, tax, rebate, and subsidy strategy. How consistent the state's message and incentives decide how successful a given direction will be. <br /><br />The biggest problem with this myth is that it feeds a hyper-capitalist ideology. Proponents say we should make the government smaller and leave innovation to private enterprise. Clearly, competition and a free market are needed to produce groundbreaking innovation. This ideology feeds legislation that gets turned into law and skews the relationship between risk and reward. One example is in the 1970s the National Venture Capital Association succeeded in lobbying for a 50% fall (40% to 20%) in capital gains tax over 5 years. <br /><br />In the US we are firm believers in capitalism. It is an economic system that has led us and many other countries to be successful in building wealth, adjusting dynamically to new times and innovations, and allocating capital in an optimal manner. The problem with capitalism is that in an unrestricted nature it leads to inequality. People and firms exploit areas that I will call “arbitrage” where they get an outsized return for the risk they take. Examples of these areas of arbitrage are venture capital returns, underwriting safe insurance premiums on large public work projects (Robert Moses would give these to favored banks), executive compensation based on short-term metrics that can be gamed through finance tricks such as stock buybacks, monopolistic pricing such as the duopoly of visa and MasterCard who make ~50% margins based on their duopoly and ability to fleece sellers, platforms becoming sellers on their own platform (amazon basics, Kirkland brand, Whole Foods 360).<br /><br />The nature of regulation is to plug gaps as they appear. Therefore, regulation is always behind the curve barely able to keep up. Regulation is hindered further because it is a part of this system and influenced by people with power and money who want to protect themselves. The people who are being exploited have little representation. They have no power. They have no money. In this way, capitalism ends up benefiting a subset of people who are able to exploit others by risking less and still taking the majority of the return. These people tell stories of how they are deserving of such outsized returns because of the risks they took and how much good they do for society in the way of jobs, productivity, and products. They use their money and power to lobby and propagandize to keep things from changing and entrench their position in the world.<br /><br />Income inequality has reached staggering proportions in recent years. This is a problem. <br /><br />Inequality is necessary. We need to reward people who innovate. We need to give higher returns to those who take more risks. But, it is unfair the outsized reward people at the top command. We have to shrink these gaps. To push the wealth levels closer together. In the end, a more equal society will be healthier and happier.<br /><br />There must be equality between the amount of risk taken and the reward received. Studies show when this relationship is equal, innovation decreases inequality. When this relationship is unequal, innovation increases inequality. <br /><br />What happens is that risk is socialized, and profit is privatized. This means the state, which is subsidized by taxpayers, takes on the role of de-risking by investing in the earliest stages of innovation. Once an innovation has been de-risked by the state, venture capital and private enterprise jump in, much closer to commercialization where financial gains are realized, and reap an outsized portion of the rewards. <br /><br />The main vehicle to return investment back to the state is through taxes. Unfortunately, the main actors who reap outsized financial rewards from state-funded innovation, can use their money and lobbying powers to avoid taxes and retain a majority of their return (arbitrage). It is important that the state capture a share of the returns of de-risking innovative technologies more in line with the risk it took. With these returns, the state can directly fund investments in future innovation and create a virtuous cycle. <br /><br />The green revolution is the most important innovation revolution in front of us. <br /><br />It is time-sensitive and requires immediate action now. Otherwise, many people will suffer and the economic consequences will be huge, hurting growth and hindering our ability to develop solutions. <br /><br />I do not believe climate change will be solved through individual action. As individuals, we can make decisions to use less water, less electricity, and less co2 emitting machines. However, this requires a conscious commitment that hurts an individual's quality of life with no apparent result to the overall system. Also, one person's restriction has no impact on the major polluters which are large corporations and wealthy individuals who will not willingly curtail their emissions. <br /><br />Outside forces can make changes to the system. COVID-19 wildly reduced CO2 emissions as travel was forcibly curtailed by governments. In Europe, energy solidarity enforced by governments helps countries wean themselves off of Russian gas. It is at the government level where change must occur.<br /><br />For governments to be successful they must have a comprehensive strategy that includes direct investment, tax incentives, subsidies, and most importantly commitment that does not change or waver from year to year. It is the long-term commitment that will allow a system to thrive with the knowledge that they have the full support of its government. Private enterprises can make investments now that will become profitable 10 years from now, knowing that the subsidies and support will be there. <br /><br />I see tension between the short term and the long term as fundamental in this discussion. <br /><br />We as humans are short-time horizon thinkers. Our current society has been set up to focus on the short term. This is easier. It is very difficult to forecast what the future will look like and how our actions now will affect the future. But, we have to try. We know if we don’t take steps now, climate change will cause trillions of economic damage and kill many people. <br /><br />It is always a balance. <br />The right balance between long-term and short-term.<br />The right balance of inequality.<br />The right balance of free market capitalism and regulation. <br /><br />The pendulum is too far on the side of the short term, of free market of capitalism, of inequality. <br /><br />As a society how do we go about dragging the pendulum from its current resting place to one that provides for a fairer and happier society? Can we create an economic system that keeps the benefits of capitalism but helps us more effectively tackle big problems like income inequality and climate change?<br /><br />One idea is to shift our time horizon back. We can try to see the long term and incorporate this into our thinking and decision-making. A concrete idea put forth by Kim Stanley Robinson is to create a Ministry for the Future that fights for the rights of those not born yet. If these people could get legal standing, then litigation could be brought against corporations that are not respecting their rights. This would force our current system to actually think about how decisions now will affect future generations. <br /><br />Another idea is to reward time more than money invested. Time is a finite resource that everyone has the same amount of. It is not subject to the Pareto rule like money and power are. This would mean that companies should reward workers more than shareholders. Workers in firms funded by venture capital should capture a larger percentage of the return than the 10%-15% that is normally allocated to the employee pool. <br /><br />A last idea is that the state could take a 1% stake in every US company that is created, public or private. That way it is equally invested in the long-term success of every company and is incentivized to provide an environment that makes these companies successful. The state can’t be cheated out of its return on investment like corporations currently do with taxes. While the state would have a huge amount of assets, these would be very un-liquid. This idea requires a bit more thought and fleshing out. <br /><br />In conclusion, this book has made me rethink my relationship with government and how I view capitalism. A career as a public servant looks more appealing than it once did. <br />
